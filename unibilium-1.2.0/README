Unibilium is a very basic terminfo library. It doesn't depend on curses or any
other library. It also doesn't use global variables, so it should be
thread-safe.

Basic documentation is in the doc/ directory.

To use it, compile unibilium.c, uninames.c, and uniutil.c into a library.
Include "unibilium.h" in your code.

Alternatively use the provided Makefile:
    make PREFIX=/usr/local && make install PREFIX=/usr/local

Other variables that can be set on the command line include CFLAGS
(C compiler options) and DESTDIR (build for installation into $PREFIX
but copy the built files into $DESTDIR/$PREFIX instead).

See the LICENSE file for licensing information.
