=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <unibilium.h>
 
 unibi_term *unibi_from_mem(const char *p, size_t n);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function parses a compiled terminfo entry that starts at I<p> and is I<n>
bytes long and constructs a C<unibi_term> object from it. When you're done with
it, you should call C<unibi_destroy> to free it.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

A pointer to a new C<unibi_term>. In case of failure, C<NULL> is returned and
C<errno> is set.

=head1 ERRORS

=over

=item C<EINVAL>

The passed bytes don't look like a valid terminfo entry.

=item C<EFAULT>

I<n> is too small for a valid terminfo entry.
